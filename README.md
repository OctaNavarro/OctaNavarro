### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 My background: I´m a full stack web developer who has recently graduated from a very demanding and insightful webdev bootcamp where I learned how to develop individual and group projects (with react, redux, node.js, express), using agile methodologies as SCRUM. I also learned how to lead a group in my role as Teaching Assistant. Prior to this, I've worked for 4 years as a biomedical engineer at a cardiological institution in my local town, managing and administrating the medical equipment and training the staff, regarding that equipment. Hopefully in the near future, I will be able to merge these two extraordinary fields of the tech world.

- ⚡  Some of my hobbies:  
- 
    🧗‍♂️ rock climbing: where I learned how to face fear and conquer it

    ⚽ futbol: where I learned how to be a team player

    🎸 playing music: where I learned that not everything has to look useful to generate a huge impact in people
